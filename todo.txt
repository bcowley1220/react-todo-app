  - Mobile UX/UI
    - I normally would have built this mobile first, but wanted to focus more on 
    functionality than UX/UI initially.
    - Move task form to the bottom and sticky it
    - Add flip button to switch between current and finished tasks
    - adjust width of containers to maximize space
    - .iconWrapper needs to have it's flex-flow turned to column
    - Icons need to be make a bit bigger, potentially add in swipe functionality later

  - PWA:
    - implement in PWA functionality
  
  - Host on Github pages
