Welcome to my React Todo App! The instructions to get the environment and application up and running locally reside below. This is a living project that I'll be slowly working on building out new features for as time progresses. I intend to create two seperate forks for this repo eventually that contains the PWA and Native versions of this web app.

It is presently functional using React Hooks, and I included commented out code for the class based functionality. If/when it is needed I will add in Context, but for such a small app there doesn't seem to be a justification to use Contect at this moment. There is still some color scheme work to do, along with implementation of a toggled dark mode... but that is for later. This app was built Mobile-First using CSS @media and a few specific breakpoints.

## Instructions For Install & Running The App
I am going to assume that you have NPM or some form of package manager installed on your machine. If not, please click the following link and https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow the install instructions for NodeJS and NPM.

- Hit the clone repo button and paste that command into your terminal in the parent folder you'd like this project to live.
- Run the following commands:
  - npm install
  - npm start dev
-If it does not automatically bring up a new window in your default browser, open a new tab in your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/






This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
